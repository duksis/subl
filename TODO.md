## TODO
# List of thing that I would like to be preconfigured for my sublime text2 instalation

* Add sublime package control + list of packages for it to install
* Add possibility to pass params `source .install.sh CONFIG=git://github.com/<me>/<my_config_repo>`
* Make the script callable like rvm's one: `curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s`
* Verify that sublime is not running before uninstalling
* Markdown preview
